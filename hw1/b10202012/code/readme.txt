5. There are individual codes for each subquestion named `code5_[number].py`.

    (a) After running the code, it needs human laboring to determine the plaintext. If needed, one can connect the terminal locally and paste the encrypted passphrase into the code. After determining the plaintext, paste the passphrase back to the terminal.  
    (b) Same as above. But the secretpy package should be installed.  
    (c)  
    (d) This question can be directly run and get the flag. The commented block is the brute force search used in the beginning. After finding some plaintext, it can switch to the code below the block. (The tqdm package is used to check the progress. One can eliminate if not needed. )

6. The code is written in Google Colab. One can import into Colab and directly run all. Alternatively, one can install the package RsaCtfTool and run the command as the code. The directory should be checked.

7. There are individual codes for each subquestion named `code7_[number].py`.

    (a) Directly run the code. There may fail by chance due to the last two padding may accidentally valid. If this is the case, run the code again.  
    (b) Directly run the code. It may fail sometimes; run it again. (The tqdm package is used to check the progress. One can eliminate if not needed. )

8. The code needs the collision pdf given by Google named `shattered-1.pdf` and `shattered-2.pdf`. Run directly and the three flags will be printed out.
